I feel embarassed. Yesterday I got the code working in one hour. Today I wasted 3 hours on a few lines of code in an effort to traverse the DOM [document object model]. Then I struggled to realize that the solution that I had already created in an array obj.salesPerHour. I never would have struggled with this a year ago.

Well, at least my clever idea of attaching it to the table footer actually worked well enough. Now it always appends to the bottom of the table. And at least I understood the concept well enough--a nested for loop where one went across columns and the other went across rows. The math seems to be broken though, and I can not figure out why.

A darn shame I could not create a SQL DB for this to write to. A simple query would have done this all easily.

I wanted a refresher and that is what I get. I think I will take the nights and weekends version in an effort to keep
