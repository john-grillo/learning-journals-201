I have to say that if there is any one single thing I learned today, it was to always, ALWAYS, make sure that one is on the correct branch.

The proper workflow should be:
git branch / git checkout -b some_branch
git status
git add
git status
git commit
git push

  I had a bad habit of starting work on master and not realizing it. Always make sure you on a branch for a feature, not the feature itself.
