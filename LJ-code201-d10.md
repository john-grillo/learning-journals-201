Today I had a wonderful refresher course on CSS3. Namely, floats and getting elements to properly display the layout.

This is much harder for me than it should be. But, it has been several years since I sat down to do some serious front-end design work. So I just have to keep at it. And learn to use display: inline-block less.

I do wish today had been entirely about catching up and not about trying to do that and do a CSS layout challenge. IT was a great challenge, but we should have only needd the HTML to deal with and not make that and the CSS as well.
