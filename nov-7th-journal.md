#Nov. 7th Codefellows 201 Journal
##First entry. I did a thing.

I went to the first day of CodeFellows and I enjoyed myself. It was nice to run into people I saw in the summer 201 course. A shame that I could not finish the series over the summer. But I was happy to learn that CodeFellows is very supportive in both the program and the alumni in helping people.

I also learned that CodeFellows could be moving into a new building. Not sure when. Hopefully not until well after the 201 section is over.

Because I have done much of this already, I will use the time to learn more about LINUX and GIT and of course, perfect my mad CSS skills. Everyone needs to learn the finer points of FlexBox.
