###Salmon Cookie Stand project.


  This was a pretty tough project. I just had a hard time getting my brain activated, I guess. I should have been able to whip this out quicker. Thankfully, I was able to get help. "You're on the right track. You're just trying to do too much at once."  Thankfully, the only thing hurt is my pride. I wanted a review and I got one.
 
I learned more on how to manipulate the DOM, use: `document.getElementByID`, `document.createElement`, `node.appendChild`, `node.textContent`. I struggled with learning on what constituted a node and how to add items to it, namely text. I am sure that it will become much clearer in the morning.  Special thank-yous are in order: Albert Reel, Aaron and Stephanie.  
I hope we get a chance to learn more about DOM traversal and how to add things to the DOM without borking everything.

On the other hand, I did find this sweet salmon ascii art. via http://salmon.ascii.uk/

And just to see if anyone actually read these, this is my personal code in life:

>**Emotion, yet peace.
>Ignorance, yet knowledge.
>Passion, yet serenity.
>Chaos, yet harmony.
>Death, yet the Force. **

Respond with the Sith code and I will buy you a coke. See if you can do throw in a Darth Sideous laugh as well.
