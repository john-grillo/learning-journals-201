###Salmon Cookie Stand project.


  This was a pretty tough project. But things went way easier overall today. Implementing the constructor functions just made more sense than remaking them every, single, time for a new function.

I did have a problem with remaking several methods that I had already made. I just need to slow down and do one thing at a time.  

And hopefully, with time, I will have a substantially easier time handling DOM traversal and node creation in the future.
