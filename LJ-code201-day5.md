I learned a lot today. 
I will keep working the habit of double-checking what branch I am on.
I especially liked the coding lab exercise at the end of the week. It was a very clever way of incorporating developing functions, loops and especially arrays. I tip my hat to whoever developed it. 

I was just wondering if there was a way to use the .reduce method...hope we can look it over in class.
Anyway, a special thank-you to Aaron to pointing out the small errors in code that made it difficult to complete.
Also, a special thank-you to Stephanie as well. It is good to know that someone understands that my failure to submit an original assignment was due to submitting the wrong branch. 

Getting familiar with the GIT workflow has been especially helpful. It is kind of embarassing that I do not have a stronger background with GIT.  

Since most has been a review for me, I think I will try and help others more. Teaching others gives you a deeper knowldge of the technology and will ultimately make me a better person and candidate.  Anyway, I will just take everything as it comes and use it to be smarter and teach myself new things as much as I possibly can.
