### Making tables to the screen

What I learned today: Eat less. That Don Pedro burrito is sitting in my stomach like a brick. I regret the decision to eat the whole burrito platter.

But in all seriousness, what John Grillo learned today was the importance of event handlers and temporary, local variables in an effort to handle/import/export a given store or array item into the next and ultimately print the thing to screen. I also feel liek I now have a more intuitive understanding or use of things like getElementById() and .textContent.

John Grillo also learned the JavaScript is still a script--meaning that I can not implement functions at the bottom and call them in the top or middle like I did with C++. 

John Grillo also showed a few great people the magical wonders of the wget command in linux, espeically the -i flag [download based on url in file; each new line produces a new download) the -v [no longer be verbose] and -P, which specifies a file directory.

Today was a good day and I hope it gets even better tomorrow. I can feel my programming prowess returning.
