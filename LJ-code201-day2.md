Please, please, let the election pass peacefully.
I learned how to properly branch and merge branches in git today.
Also, I rediscovered the 3 column layout in CSS. I even did a few
fancy tricks such as nth-child-of-type(even).

I also remade a guessing game. I just now need to do an event handler. This way it only loads when I want them to.
